hello! this is the first README file from me! If you're reading this, then hello!

Here I'll tell you why I'm doing all this:

I want to make a kind of neuron that will be the best way to differ from traditional neurons, and be the most optimal, fastest, and most accurate using learning, research, improvement, help, or communication (the main thing is that at least one of these points is in the model)
I also want to say that it should differ not only from traditional neurons, but also from those that were invented (for example, with self-learning: with q-learning)
I'm 12 years old and knowing, coming up with, and thinking well is already very good, but as others would say... VERY good
I don't like to show myself on the smart side, but I want to say that I stand out with my mind (but maybe not only...)
I also like to talk to someone every time, because I don't have friends for this, there I show myself from the smart side, tell facts, ideas, as well as my types of neurons.
well... I've already had an affair with girls... I don't want to talk about it, but now I don't like to love, especially to love girls, I hate reality.
if anyone wants to know more about me (a lot of interesting things), please be active!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

well... Bye, everyone! Meet me at my next README or even post.👋😄
